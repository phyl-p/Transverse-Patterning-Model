%the following displays the square weight matrix as if it were specifying
%the pixels of a square black and weight image. For example, the ith row,
%jth column of the weight matrix indicates the strength of the synaptic
%connection from the ith neuron to the jth neuron; this in turn is
%represented by the whiteness of the (i,j)th pixel.
%Because the difference in 
%weight values in the square matrix itself does not result in a clear
%image, the 'brightness' multiplier was used to increase the image contrast.
